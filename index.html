    <p>My name is Jacob and I am 25 years old.  I live currently live in Rocky River, Ohio, however, I grew up in Ashland, Ohio.  I like to spend my time playing video games, listening to music, or being outside.  I enjoy traveling.  In the United States I have been to the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain National Park, Zion National Park, Yosemite National park, as well as a few other places around the country.

    <p>I have also had the opportunity to travel to a few different places outside of the U.S. as well.  I have been to Canada, The Bahamas, Italy, and Iceland.  My favorite of those trips, and my most recent, was the one to Iceland.  The scenery there was beautiful and there was a lot of good hiking to be done there.  The most interesting part about the trip was that because of the time of year we went and how far north the country sits, it never got fully dark the whole time we were there.  Overall, visiting Iceland was a really unique experience and hopefully I will get a chance to go back at some point in the future.</p>
